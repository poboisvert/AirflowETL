Yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
What? (Uh) What? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Dre, you ready? (Woo, woo, woo, woo)
C'mon (Yo, we gotta kill ‘em with this one!)
Alright (Check, check, check, check, check)
Get 'em!

Verse 1: Dr. Dre
Cut 'em undercover, timeless
Ready for 'em, progress
Feelin' like I'm just gettin' started
Two shots back for my dearly departed
Uh, you are now dеalin' with a monster
Boss shit, profits
Doc Dre, bitch, I'm a prophet
Black Wall Street, niggas know whеre the stock is
Heh, try me
Niggas never see me, but it ain't hard to find me
Heh, unwinding
Shit's blinding, still grinding
Uprising (Agh)
Stop talking 'bout the past, I'm the future, nigga (Agh)
Nigga like me still here, motherfucker, go figure
Lookin' for my next gold digger
This summer here gon' be colder than winter
Already told you, I fold you like hundreds of billions
And you can go missing, put that on my children
Bet that, nigga, what?
Regret that, run it up
Heh, and I'm about to sum it up
This shit here that problem
Livin' at the bottom of a bottle
""Full throttle"" my motto, eh
Fuckin' with me like fuckin' with the lotto
That awful in your nostril
In a brothel, this is gospel
Yeah, I'ma need all that, pronto

Chorus: Dr. Dre &amp; Eminem
Yes, I, yes, I, yes, I ride 'til I die
Give a fuck if you bitches die
Put a motherfucking hole in your face
Back up, bitch, don't even try
I am that motherfucker, been the coldest
Why you on that? No one know us
Overdosed on what dope is (Yeah)
Hip-hop shit sell better than the coke did

Verse 2: Eminem
Like a satanic cult, it's
An old ritual slaughtering GOATs, bitch (GOATs, bitch, yeah)
You're fucking with the original, flow's sick
And anybody can get it—COVID (Fuck with that?)
I done wrote shit that was so sharp
I could slit my own fucking throat with it
So rich, I got more chips than my shoulders
And I'm about as approachable as a roach is (Roach is)
Yeah, so better steer clear from him
And here comes a nuclear bomb for your eardrums
Lyricism at its most fearsome and fierce
We're on another tier like a tear duct's upper echelon (Yeah)
Your career sucked (Meaning what?), it was sheer luck (Like what?)
Like a fuckin' leprechaun with his beard cut
(You're the) Punisher, weapon drawn with a beer gut (Haha)
You're slower than a Decepticon with its gear stuck
(And I what?) I serial kill, and you're Kellogg's (What?)
I love checks and I hate tricks
And you're a fake bitch (Bitch)
I could spot you like you 'bout to weight lift (Yeah)
Bitch, I'm badder than cake mix
(But I) Can't be whipped with egg beaters (Nah)
You cunts must be out of your labias
And God's my alias, so if I don't have faith in me
Then it basically makes me an atheist (Woo!)
Nate Diaz got the world by the tracheas
In a chokehold and a sleeper (*Snores*)
Yeah, and me and Dre are like dog hair (Woof)
We're both in our lab coats like retrievers (Grrr)
But like a Doberman, I'm a whole different breed of (What?)
Animal mutt mixed with a overachiever (Yeah)
Oh, you're the king of rap? You're 'bout to be overthrown
Like a pass over the head of an open receiver
This shit could end up comin' to blows like a wiener (Haha)
But I ain't finished puttin' these hoes through the wringer (Nah)
Like clothes in between the two rollers, and– wait, no
What I mean is flows interwoven, I treat 'em like thread (Why?)
That's how I wound up sewin' Machine up
So, fucks, if you don't givin' me the
Time to ride or die, 'cause you're either both or you're neither (Yeah, yeah)
Throw a middle finger up if you're rollin', but, me, I'm gonna— (Yeah, yeah)

Chorus: Dr. Dre
Ride 'til I die
Give a fuck if you bitches die
Put a motherfucking hole in your face
Back up, bitch, don't even try

Big 4L, big steppers
Big footprints, pussy (Southside on the track, yeah)
Pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy

Verse 1
Big 4L, I'm a member (Yeah)
Leave an opp cold, like December (What?)
.45 on me, it's a Kimber (And what?)
AK knockin' down trees, like timber
Get your baby mama 'fore we bend her (21)
Hit the windshield, not the fender (21)
Givin' out smoke my agenda (21)
Throw the white flag, they surrender (Pussy)
All black tux, I'm a businessman (Pussy)

Playin' with the rock like I'm Jigga man
Gotta look a nigga in the eyes when you kill a man

Chorus
Glock in my lap, everywhere I'm strapped
Most these rappers cap, I ain't givin' dap
Glenwood to the flat, used to rob and trap
Money tall, Shaq, choppa bullets, splat
Chuck E. Cheese, rat, we get rodents whacked
Way too many steppers, I can't hold 'em back
Body full of scars, face full of tats
You pray on your knees, I pray to my strap

Verse 2
Say you want smoke, but the fire come with it
Money on your head, nigga, we'll come get it
New Kel-Tec put a hun-dun in it
'Partment so sweet, threw a honey bun in it
Keep it in the street, I ain't doin' no squealin'
I don't never put women in my business
Full-time rapper, I ain't doin' no drillin'
Woah, woah, I can make a M in my sleep (Straight up)
17 breakin' down a P (On God)
18 start sellin' hard with Lil B
Hundred dollar three-five, a whip from D
Ridin' down Glenwood, tank on E
All about the money, I ain't never smoke weed
Cool young nigga, still take yo' cheese (Pussy)
Not mine, this bitch for us (21)
The gang is what I trust (Straight up)
Don't argue, we don't fuss (Straight up)
No talkin', he get touched (Straight up)
I can't smoke my opps (On God)
'Cause all my opps is dust (Pussy)
He think he the battery, we call him Elon Musk (Pussy)
Open your mouth when I bust (21)
Suck me up slow, don't rush (21)
Havin' threesomes is a must (Straight up)
Hit it from the back and she cussed (On God)

She used to ride on the bus (Damn)
I walk around with them thigh pads (21)

These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care, he's
A problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out (Bitch!)
'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stockin' cap
His stepfather hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go

Chorus: Steven Tyler (&amp; Eminem)
(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Verse 2: Eminem
Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely ‘cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate (Huh-uh)
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you (Yep), journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, B
It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you! (Bitch!)

Chorus: Steven Tyler (&amp; Eminem)
(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Sing that shit!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Verse 3: Eminem
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued
See, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they wanna get one ‘cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up, ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (Ha-ha!)
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it ‘cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone, just let our spirits
Live on through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, and we can…

Chorus: Steven Tyler (&amp; Eminem)
Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
