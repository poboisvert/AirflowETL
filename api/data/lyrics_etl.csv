Verse 1: Serj Tankian
I will never feed off the evergreen luster of your heart
All because we all live in the valley of the walls
When they speak we can peek from the windows of their mouths
To see the land the women chant as they fly up to the sun

Verse 2: Serj Tankian
Books all say different things while people flap their yellow wings
Tryna soar, being a whore, life and almost everything
Sheep that ran off from the herd, maybe dead, but now's a bird
Able to fly, able to die, able to fuck your mother's earth

On the other side, the other side, other side
Do you ever try to fly? Do you ever try to fly?

Don't ever try to fly, don't ever try to fly
Don't ever try to fly unless you leave your body on the other side
Never try to die, did you ever try to die?

Lay beside me, tell me what they've done
Speak the words I want to hear, to make my demons run

If you can understand the me, then I can understand the you

Lay beside me, under wicked sky
Through black of day, dark of night, we share this paralyze

Black heart scarring darker still, but there's no sun shining through

Question is - can I get some? Know what I'm saying?
Ack-rite, bitch
When I see you in the spot, you just act right, you know what I'm saying?
When I yank you by the fuckin' arm
Don't be looking at a nigga crazy
Just give up the digits and be the fuck out, you know what I'm saying?
Let me break it down for y'all

Verse 1: Hittman
It was just one of those days
When I wanted to catch sunrays
It`s fun to gitt blunted on a Sunday afternoon
Nigga Bathed & got groomed, grabbed the gat for misbehavors
And the chocolate flavored boom, lost in hip-hop tunes
Zoom-zoom like the Commodores
Wonder will we have drama or, end up clowning whores
Round up four good-to-go girls
Like them Barbary Coast girls, riding shotgun, baby
I be postin all-world in the ride
Sipping 151 done gave me too much pride to back down
Soon as we get to The Beach I'mma put my fuckin mack down
I'm playin lead, not the background
It's time to put Bronson on the map now
Walk with my hand on my Johnson, crack a smile
Cuties peep my style, if I don't get some ackrite
I'mma have to ack-wild

Hook: Hittman
Blunt in my left hand, drink in my right
Strap by my waistline, cause niggas don't fight
Sucker free for life, so you better think twice
(Aight? And a give a nig' some ackrite)
I'm the type of nigga playa-haters don't like
Snatchin' up your honey for some late night hype
And snobby-ass bitches get slapped out of spite
(Aight? So give a nig' some ackrite, right)

Hittman
Uhhhhh.. drink kicking in, I'm stimulated
For those that don't know big words: I'm FUCKIN FADED
Eighty-three degrees, ease to a shaded spot
Our first spot was cool till some gangsters made it hot
Now we plot and pose
Plus we watchin hoes, with lots of flesh exposed
Getting swarmed by those type of niggas
With no game but brown-nose
So I impose only like pros can
""Yo, is this your man?"" ""No.""
Grab the bitch's hand, ""I'm Hittman.""
Bling! Gold chain gleam
""You're very eligible for my summer league team.""
Maybe too extreme cause the sister got steamed
Then Miss Thing tried to scream on my brethren
I got mad, spit phlegm on the name
Stefan, tattooed on her arm
Ho you ain't the bomb, must be a dyke
Gitcho' lips swoll, or give a nig' some ackrite

Hook: Hittman
Blunt in my left hand, drink in my right
Strap by my waistline, cause niggas don't fight

Snatchin' up your honey for some late night hype
And snobby-ass bitches get slapped out of spite

Fronting on the ack-rite, causing me to act up
Good Samaritans save that ho from getting slapped up
My homies crack up at the scene I made
Yo my actions ain't serene when a nigga's on fade
If it wasn't for the one-time brigade
I woulda sprayed at the hooker tramp
As cops parade I'm afraid it's time to break camp
Make tracks, where else can we go to take hoes
From fake macks? {*CAR HORN*} Aiyyo, chase them girls
In that black Maxima, the passenger, almost fractured her
Neckbone, looking back at us
Plus, they on the dick cause the Caddy's plush
They blush, I bumrush the huss, with the largest crush
Try to swing an ep tonight so I don't have to keep in touch
Keep it on hush without the tippin`
Macking interrupted by some niggas set-tripping
Clip in the strap, I showed these niggas how to act

It's like the international, house of pancakes (Ugh!)
All on the grass (Ugh!), every bitch passed (Ugh!)
I'm first, not last, when we all hit the ass (Ahh)
Doin' tricks jacked up like a six (What!)
One pussy, and thirteen dicks
Gangstas don't dance, we boogie (Bow!)
Niggas run out and get ya cookie
Westside

Who's that dumpin' out that window, hoo-riding?
(West-Side!) Nobody survives when...
I got my steel up, throwing my shit up, pulling the trigger (Ugh)
What the fuck you lookin' at, nigga? (Punk!)
(*Whistles*) True blue when I bust
Leavin' bodies hangin' like the tongue of my Chucks
Chalk another one, homicidal in the G-ride
I swear I'm killing every nigga standing outside
Letting 'em have it, with my double barrel sawed off (Ugh!)
I'm smoking on everybody, niggas, bitches, and all
Stretch 'em out in broad daylight, motherfuck the witnesses
Eyes big as golf balls from the funny cigarette (Haha, yeah)
As the sun frowns on my foreheadt, I sweat murder (Murder!)
Which makes me the walking dead man
Bringing more bad news than Schleprock
When I bust shots (Ugh!), Dub-C keep the hammer cocked

Chorus 2: All, Ice Cube
The gangsta, the killa, and the dope dealer (Yeah!)
The gangsta, the killa, and the dope dealer (Yeah!)

Verse 3: Mack 10
Well, it's the nigga that's housin' the scene
I got pounds of green and birds
Sittin' on the triple beams (Yes!)
I put it down on and off the record my flats a
Double decker, marble floors all checkered
Now what can I say every bitch I lay be pure and
Bombay like Peruvian ye
So I brag and I boast man I got the most, man (Whoa-whoa!)
I make more deliveries than the postman (B-I-ITCH!)
My homie Carlito plug me with the amigos
So, now, it's kilos, five and six double zeros
Now, what's next? I'm stuffed like Kotex
Blindin' niggas with the boogers in my Rolex
With my aces OT on a regular basis
We got pavé'd faces fightin' federal cases (Ha!)
Cause ain't nothin' reala' than niggas gettin' they scrilla
Like a gangsta, a killa, and Mack I'll be the dope dealer

Chorus 1
Killa Cali is the state, murda (Murda!)
Killa Cali is the state, murda (Murda!)
Killa Cali is the state, murda (Murda!)

Chorus 2: All
The gangsta, the killa, and the dope dealer (Murda!)
The gangsta, the killa, and the dope dealer (Murda!)
The gangsta, the killa, and the dope dealer (Murda!)
The gangsta, the killa, and the dope dealer (Murda!)
The gangsta, the killa, and the dope dealer (Murda!)
The gangsta, the killa, and the dope dealer (Murda!)

Half of these rappers weren’t trappin’ when I was choppin’ the do or die
Suge had me in, I went Puffy like Zab Judah eye

Clothes smellin' like trees
Diggin' my earth, find my roots and weeds
My truth bleeds right back in the arm
No scar, but I left my mark

Clothes smellin' like trees
Diggin' my earth, find my roots and weeds
My truth bleeds right back in the arm
No scar, but I left my mark
My friend got clean and O.D.'ed, life is just that dark

But life is just that bright
That when the sunset shines
I seen the graff he writes
I'm back tonight, with a sack to light
In honor of the past I write

I'm wide open, with no glass of wine
Stuck in a barrel, I'll get better with time
While you measure how the pleasure declines
I'm stackin' cheddar while the bread just rise
With my eyes and my ears glued here on my grind, cutty

Creepin' on a come up
No sleepin' till the sun's up
Tellin' secrets to the drum thumps
Pledge allegiance to the blood pump
Until I leak my last liter, here's my one love

And all these angels got their guns up
But no fear when my teeth and my tongue touch
I am here, and I speak for the young bloods
Who've seen the flood, and they drug all the anchors up
And set sail through the world, in the name of trust
Hard work, and the crux that it made in us

I'm 'bout to bust, all my veins full of gold dust
That 1985 California gold rush, in the spine plus the flesh that it holds up
I'm out for mines and my wolves got it sewn up
One crow, one eagle on my shoulders
And my eyes hold the light that approache"

Verse 1: Coolio
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
‘Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long, that
Even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
Fool, I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the streetlight

Verse 2: Coolio
Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watchin' got me chasin' dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies is down so don't arouse my anger
Fool, death ain't nothin' but a heart beat away
I'm livin' life do or die, what can I say?
I'm 23 now, but will I live to see 24?
The way things is goin' I don't know

Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's runnin', but half of them ain't lookin'
It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they frontin'; that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool!

Woo, Shady, Aftermath (B-G-O-V)
Hey, bitch (Aw, shit, hey)
There she goes, shakin' that ass on the flo'
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole

I think I'm losin' control (Bobby, Bobby, Bobby Creek)

Verse 1: Bobby Creekwater
I bought a lil' Patrón, I get in the Henn, I'm gone
My eyes ain't clear and I'm gone so she hearin' me wrong
I'm kinda in the zone 'cause the DJ playin' my song
Just another opportunity for sayin' I'm known
I'm from Atlanta, so southern ain't just a part of my grammar
I can up and cock the hammer for any nigga with anim'
But I came here to get on Goose and Tropicana
Get loose, put some more in my juice and your caboose
Sippin' everything from white grain to deuce-deuce
With nothin' to gain but migraines and loose tooths
Eminem came with Obie, Stat and Proof too
Bobby Creek is in the place, the name is new, too
But the money been around, my drinks is ten a round
I can make her spin around, least she keep her dinner down
Simmer down, we can hit the telly when the fun stops
And I let you and your girl come tickle my gumdrops, yo

Verse 2: Nate Dogg
Three to the one from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessy
I've been to the motherfuckin' mountain top
Heard motherfuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo' ass I'm gon' continue to rock
Get your ass of the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy, just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie

Pre-Chorus: Nate Dogg
We 'bout to have a party, turn the music up
Let's get it started, go 'head and shake your butt
I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin', baby? Step right up
Some girls, they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say, every day she be givin' it up

Chorus: Nate Dogg & Eminem
Now shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me, c'mon, girl
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me, aw, girl
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me, c'mon, girl
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me (Obie Trice)

Verse 3: Obie Trice
One slug couldn't snuff young cuz
Goodness gracious, haters stay on his nuts
Would just like a hoodrat chick who was curious
Serious, full breast, ready to touch
Who's that in the coupe blew back with a blue new hat
Givin' head while he poppin' the clutch?
True that, I had a few, Obie rollin' with Bruce
And Nathaniel annually knockin' the boots
It's all manual the way I get 'em outta they shoes
Talk a lil' shit, then they anus'll ooze
Hock a lil' spit on my dang-a-lang, boo
It's Shady, you know the name of the crew
You know the aim is to bang you in a mansion
With a Magnum when the night came to the matinee
Mathers, Nate, Obie came to party
You better ask somebody

Chorus: Nate Dogg
Now shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me, c'mon, girl
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me, aw, girl
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me, c'mon, girl
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
