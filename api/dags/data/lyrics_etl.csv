1,3oXnTeP6me5QMkbVT7Lv19,Los Angeles,2021-07-18T23:18:50.120Z,"I met a man
He was a good man
Sailing and shoring
Dancing the beta can-can
Making me foreign
Oh yeah

I want to live in Los Angeles
Not the one in Los Angeles
No, not the one in South California
They got one in South Patagonia

I want to live in Los Angeles
Not the one in Los Angeles
They got a bunch down in Moleville
They got a bunch more still

I want to live in Los Angeles
Not the one in Los Angeles
They got one in twenty-five two five
Works just like a beehive

I want to live in Los Angeles
Not the one in Los Angeles
Counting helicopters on Saturday night
The symphony of the fair light

I hear them saying Los Angeles
In all the black and white movies
And if you think they star-spangled us
How come we say Los Angeles?

I'll wait in Los Angeles
I'll wait in the pouring sun
No way
For not anyone
No way

I met a man
He was a good man
Sailing and shoring
He got a betatron, man
Talking that foreign
Oh yeah

I'll wait in Los Angeles
I'll wait in the pouring sun
No way, for not anyone

I had a good home but I left
I had a good home but I left, right, left
That big fucking bomb made me deaf, deaf
A Humvee mechanic put his Kevlar on wrong
I guarantee you’ll meet up with a suicide bomb
And Hell broke luce
Hell broke luce

Verse 2
Big fucking ditches in the middle of the road
You pay a hundred dollars just for fillin’ in the hole
Listen to the general every goddamn word
How many ways can you polish up a turd
And left, right, left, left, right
Left, right
Hell broke luce
Hell broke luce
Hell broke luce

Verse 3
How is it that the only ones responsible for making this mess
Got their sorry asses stapled to a goddamn desk
And Hell broke luce
Hell broke luce
Left, right, left

Verse 4
What did you do before the war?
I was a chef, I was a chef
What was your name?
It was Jeff, Jeff
I lost my buddy and I wept, wept
I come down from the meth
So I slept, slept
I had a good home but I left, left

Verse 5
Pantsed at the wind for a joke
I pranced right in with the dope
Glanced at her shin, she said nope
Left, right, left
Nimrod Bodfish have you any wool
Get me another body bag the body bag’s full
And my face was scorched, scorched
I miss my home I miss my porch, porch
Left, right, left
Can I go home in March? (March)
My stanch was a chin full of soap
That rancid dinner with the pope
And left, right, left

Verse 6
Kelly Presutto got his thumbs blown off
Sergio’s developing a real bad cough
Sergio’s developing a real bad cough
And Hell broke luce
Hell broke luce
Hell broke luce

Verse 7
Boom went his head away
And boom went Valerie, huh
What the hell was it that the president said?
Give 'em all a beautiful parade instead
And left, right, left
While I was over here I never got to vote
I left my arm in my coat
My mom she died and never wrote
We sat by the fire and ate a goat
Just before he died he had a toke
Now I’m home and I’m blind
And I’m broke

Down kingdom come and the acid ban
I'm bad alone, burned inside out
Nothing to kill it
I hit the city

In Marianne, I dug a hole
And watched her trip on my heart of stone
And in the end all that crawled was my skin
I couldn't kill it
I hit the city
I hit the city

Ghost arrives at its bitter end
To the promised land and the dark descends
I'm bad alone, burned inside out
Nothing to kill it
I hit the city
I hit the city

I hit the city
I hit the city
I hit the city

I hit the cit"
