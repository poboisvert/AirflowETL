0,3a2jFwnts4Cf0OwJbK61SL,Gospel (with Eminem),2022-02-21T00:00:25.741Z,"Intro: Eminem &amp; Dr. Dre
Yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
What? (Uh) What? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Dre, you ready? (Woo, woo, woo, woo)
C'mon (Yo, we gotta kill ‘em with this one!)
Alright (Check, check, check, check, check)
Get 'em!

Verse 1: Dr. Dre
Cut 'em undercover, timeless
Ready for 'em, progress
Feelin' like I'm just gettin' started
Two shots back for my dearly departed
Uh, you are now dеalin' with a monster
Boss shit, profits
Doc Dre, bitch, I'm a prophet
Black Wall Street, niggas know whеre the stock is
Heh, try me
Niggas never see me, but it ain't hard to find me
Heh, unwinding
Shit's blinding, still grinding
Uprising (Agh)
Stop talking 'bout the past, I'm the future, nigga (Agh)
Nigga like me still here, motherfucker, go figure
Lookin' for my next gold digger
This summer here gon' be colder than winter
Already told you, I fold you like hundreds of billions
And you can go missing, put that on my children
Bet that, nigga, what?
Regret that, run it up
Heh, and I'm about to sum it up
This shit here that problem
Livin' at the bottom of a bottle
""Full throttle"" my motto, eh
Fuckin' with me like fuckin' with the lotto
That awful in your nostril
In a brothel, this is gospel
Yeah, I'ma need all that, pronto

Chorus: Dr. Dre &amp; Eminem
Yes, I, yes, I, yes, I ride 'til I die
Give a fuck if you bitches die
Put a motherfucking hole in your face
Back up, bitch, don't even try
I am that motherfucker, been the coldest
Why you on that? No one know us
Overdosed on what dope is (Yeah)
Hip-hop shit sell better than the coke did

Verse 2: Eminem
Like a satanic cult, it's
An old ritual slaughtering GOATs, bitch (GOATs, bitch, yeah)
You're fucking with the original, flow's sick
And anybody can get it—COVID (Fuck with that?)
I done wrote shit that was so sharp
I could slit my own fucking throat with it
So rich, I got more chips than my shoulders
And I'm about as approachable as a roach is (Roach is)
Yeah, so better steer clear from him
And here comes a nuclear bomb for your eardrums
Lyricism at its most fearsome and fierce
We're on another tier like a tear duct's upper echelon (Yeah)
Your career sucked (Meaning what?), it was sheer luck (Like what?)
Like a fuckin' leprechaun with his beard cut
(You're the) Punisher, weapon drawn with a beer gut (Haha)
You're slower than a Decepticon with its gear stuck
(And I what?) I serial kill, and you're Kellogg's (What?)
I love checks and I hate tricks
And you're a fake bitch (Bitch)
I could spot you like you 'bout to weight lift (Yeah)
Bitch, I'm badder than cake mix
(But I) Can't be whipped with egg beaters (Nah)
You cunts must be out of your labias
And God's my alias, so if I don't have faith in me
Then it basically makes me an atheist (Woo!)
Nate Diaz got the world by the tracheas
In a chokehold and a sleeper (*Snores*)
Yeah, and me and Dre are like dog hair (Woof)
We're both in our lab coats like retrievers (Grrr)
But like a Doberman, I'm a whole different breed of (What?)
Animal mutt mixed with a overachiever (Yeah)
Oh, you're the king of rap? You're 'bout to be overthrown
Like a pass over the head of an open receiver
This shit could end up comin' to blows like a wiener (Haha)
But I ain't finished puttin' these hoes through the wringer (Nah)
Like clothes in between the two rollers, and– wait, no
What I mean is flows interwoven, I treat 'em like thread (Why?)
That's how I wound up sewin' Machine up
So, fucks, if you don't givin' me the
Time to ride or die, 'cause you're either both or you're neither (Yeah, yeah)
Throw a middle finger up if you're rollin', but, me, I'm gonna— (Yeah, yeah)

Chorus: Dr. Dre
Ride 'til I die
Give a fuck if you bitches die
Put a motherfucking hole in your face
Back up, bitch, don't even try
I am that motherfucker, been the coldest
Why you on that? No one know us
Overdosed on what dope is
Hip-hop shit sell better than the coke di"

Verse 1
Big 4L, I'm a member (Yeah)

.45 on me, it's a Kimber (And what?)
AK knockin' down trees, like timber
Get your baby mama 'fore we bend her (21)
Hit the windshield, not the fender (21)
Givin' out smoke my agenda (21)
Throw the white flag, they surrender (Pussy)
All black tux, I'm a businessman (Pussy)

Playin' with the rock like I'm Jigga man
Gotta look a nigga in the eyes when you kill a man

Chorus
Glock in my lap, everywhere I'm strapped
Most these rappers cap, I ain't givin' dap
Glenwood to the flat, used to rob and trap
Money tall, Shaq, choppa bullets, splat
Chuck E. Cheese, rat, we get rodents whacked
Way too many steppers, I can't hold 'em back
Body full of scars, face full of tats
You pray on your knees, I pray to my strap

Verse 2
Say you want smoke, but the fire come with it
Money on your head, nigga, we'll come get it
New Kel-Tec put a hun-dun in it
'Partment so sweet, threw a honey bun in it
Keep it in the street, I ain't doin' no squealin'
I don't never put women in my business
Full-time rapper, I ain't doin' no drillin'
Woah, woah, I can make a M in my sleep (Straight up)
17 breakin' down a P (On God)
18 start sellin' hard with Lil B
Hundred dollar three-five, a whip from D
Ridin' down Glenwood, tank on E
All about the money, I ain't never smoke weed
Cool young nigga, still take yo' cheese (Pussy)
Not mine, this bitch for us (21)
The gang is what I trust (Straight up)
Don't argue, we don't fuss (Straight up)
No talkin', he get touched (Straight up)
I can't smoke my opps (On God)
'Cause all my opps is dust (Pussy)
He think he the battery, we call him Elon Musk (Pussy)
Open your mouth when I bust (21)
Suck me up slow, don't rush (21)
Havin' threesomes is a must (Straight up)
Hit it from the back and she cussed (On God)
I put his bitch in the Benz (21)
She used to ride on the bus (Damn)
I walk around with them thigh pads (21)
But I ain't got no yard rushed

Chorus
Glock in my lap, everywhere I'm strapped
Most these rappers cap, I ain't givin' dap
Glenwood to the flat, used to rob and trap
Money tall, Shaq, choppa bullets, splat
Chuck E. Cheese, rat, we get rodents whacked
