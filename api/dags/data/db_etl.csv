I had a good home but I left
I had a good home but I left, right, left
That big fucking bomb made me deaf, deaf
A Humvee mechanic put his Kevlar on wrong
I guarantee you’ll meet up with a suicide bomb
And Hell broke luce
Hell broke luce

[Verse 2]
Big fucking ditches in the middle of the road
You pay a hundred dollars just for fillin’ in the hole
Listen to the general every goddamn word
How many ways can you polish up a turd
And left, right, left, left, right
Left, right
Hell broke luce
Hell broke luce
Hell broke luce

[Verse 3]
How is it that the only ones responsible for making this mess
Got their sorry asses stapled to a goddamn desk
And Hell broke luce
Hell broke luce
Left, right, left

[Verse 4]
What did you do before the war?
I was a chef, I was a chef
What was your name?
It was Jeff, Jeff
I lost my buddy and I wept, wept
I come down from the meth
So I slept, slept
I had a good home but I left, left

[Verse 5]
Pantsed at the wind for a joke
I pranced right in with the dope
Glanced at her shin, she said nope
Left, right, left
Nimrod Bodfish have you any wool
Get me another body bag the body bag’s full
And my face was scorched, scorched
I miss my home I miss my porch, porch
Left, right, left
Can I go home in March? (March)
My stanch was a chin full of soap
That rancid dinner with the pope
And left, right, left

[Verse 6]
Kelly Presutto got his thumbs blown off
Sergio’s developing a real bad cough
Sergio’s developing a real bad cough
And Hell broke luce
Hell broke luce
Hell broke luce

[Verse 7]
Boom went his head away
And boom went Valerie, huh
What the hell was it that the president said?
Give 'em all a beautiful parade instead
And left, right, left
While I was over here I never got to vote
I left my arm in my coat
My mom she died and never wrote
We sat by the fire and ate a goat
Just before he died he had a toke
Now I’m home and I’m blind
And I’m broke
What is next"

Down kingdom come and the acid ban
I'm bad alone, burned inside out
Nothing to kill it

In Marianne, I dug a hole
And watched her trip on my heart of stone
And in the end all that crawled was my skin
I couldn't kill it
I hit the city
I hit the city

Ghost arrives at its bitter end
To the promised land and the dark descends
I'm bad alone, burned inside out

I don't wanna grow up
Nothin' ever seems to turn out right
I don't wanna grow up
How do you move in a world of fog
That's always changing things
Makes me wish that I could be a dog

When I see the price that you pay
I don't wanna grow up
I don't ever wanna be that way
I don't wanna grow up
Seems like folks turn into things
That they'd never want
The only thing to live for is today...

I'm gonna put a hole in my TV set
I don't wanna grow up
Open up the medicine chest
And I don't wanna grow up
I don't wanna have to shout it out
I don't want my hair to fall out
I don't wanna be filled with doubt
I don't wanna be a good boy scout
I don't wanna have to learn to count
I don't wanna have the biggest amount
I don't wanna grow up

Well when I see my parents fight
I don't wanna grow up
They all go out and drinking all night
And I don't wanna grow up
I'd rather stay here in my room
Nothin' out there but sad and gloom
I don't wanna live in a big old tomb
On Grand Street

When I see the 5 o'clock news
I don't wanna grow up
Comb their hair and shine their shoes
I don't wanna grow up
Stay around in my old hometown
I don't wanna put no money down
I don't wanna get me a big old loan
Work them fingers to the bone
I don't wanna float a broom
Fall in love and get married then boom
How the hell did it get here so soon
I don't wanna grow up"

Big wheels keep on turnin'
Carry me home to see my kin
Singin' songs about the southland
I miss Alabamy once again
And I think it's a sin, yes

Well I heard Mr Young sing about her (Southern man)
Well, I heard ol' Neil put her down
Well, I hope Neil Young will remember
A Southern man don't need him around, anyhow

Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you

In Birmingham they love the governor (Boo! Boo! Boo!)
Now we all did what we could do
Now Watergate does not bother me
Does your conscience bother you?
Tell the truth

Well my goodness gracious, let me tell you the news
My head's been wet with the midnight dew
I've been down on bended knee, talkin' to the man from Galilee
He spoke to me in the voice so sweet
I thought I heard the shuffle of the angel's feet
He called my name and my heart stood still
When he said, ""John, go do My will!""

Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter
Tell them that God's gonna cut 'em down

Well, you may throw your rock and hide your hand
Workin' in the dark against your fellow man
But as sure as God made black and white
What's done in the dark will be brought to the light

Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time

This can't be happenin' like I'm in a dream while I'm walkin'
'Cause what I'm seein' is hauntin'
Human beings like ghost and zombies
President Mugabe holdin' guns to innocent bodies in Zimbabwe
They make John Pope seem Godly, sacrilegious and blasphemous
In my lifetime, I look back at paths I walked
Where savages fought and pastors taught
Prostitutes stomp in high-heel boots
And badges scream at young black children: ""Stop, or I will shoot!""
I look back at cooked crack, plush cars that pass by
Jaguars mad fly
And I'm guilty for materialism
Blacks is still up in the prison, trust that
So save me your sorries, I'm raisin' a army
Revolutionary warfare with Damian Marley
We sparkin' the ions, marchin' to Zion
You know how Nas be, N.Y.C. state of mind I'm in
