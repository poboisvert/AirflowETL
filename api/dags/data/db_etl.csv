Yeah man
Jah will be waitin there we a shout
Jah will be waitin there

[Pre-Chorus: Damian Marley]
In this world of calamity
Dirty looks and grudges and jealousy
And police weh abuse dem authority
Media clowns we nuh know bout variety, boom

[Verse 1: Damian Marley]
Di youngest veteran a come murder dem slow
Raggamuffin sent to call me from di bush bungalow
Mi nuh watch it mek I clear out my voice now, Figaro
Emerge from the darkness with mi big blunt a glow
Di hammer dem a slam and spectator getta low
Some bwoy could a big like Bam Bam Bigelow
Buss off trigger finger, trigger hand and trigger toe
A two gun mi have mi buss dem inna stereo, 'cause

[Chorus: Damian Marley]
I got to keep on walkin', on the road to Zion, man
Hey, we got to keep it burnin', on the road to Zion, man

[Bridge: Damian Marley]
Clean and pure meditation without a doubt
Don't mek dem take you like who dem took out
Jah will be waitin there we a shout
Jah will be waitin there

[Pre-Chorus: Damian Marley]
In this world of calamity
Dirty looks and grudges and jealousy
And police weh abuse dem authority
Media clowns we nuh know bout variety
Single parents weh need some charity
Yutes weh need some love and prosperity
Instead of broken dreams and tragedy
By any plan with any means and strategy, say

[Chorus: Damian Marley &amp; Nas]
We got to keep on walkin', yeah
On the road to Zion, man, yeah
Been waitin' to do this track with you man
Yeah, ha ha, yeah yeah
You know, they know
You got to keep on walkin', yeah
On the road to Zion, man
You gotta keep walkin' y'all, yeah, yeah, you gotta keep

[Verse 2: Nas]
Sometimes, I can't help but feel helpless
I'm havin' daymares in daytime, wide awake, try to relate
This can't be happenin' like I'm in a dream while I'm walkin'
'Cause what I'm seein' is hauntin'
Human beings like ghost and zombies
President Mugabe holdin' guns to innocent bodies in Zimbabwe
They make John Pope seem Godly, sacrilegious and blasphemous
In my lifetime, I look back at paths I walked
Where savages fought and pastors taught
Prostitutes stomp in high-heel boots
And badges scream at young black children: ""Stop, or I will shoot!""
I look back at cooked crack, plush cars that pass by
Jaguars mad fly
And I'm guilty for materialism
Blacks is still up in the prison, trust that
So save me your sorries, I'm raisin' a army
Revolutionary warfare with Damian Marley
We sparkin' the ions, marchin' to Zion
You know how Nas be, N.Y.C. state of mind I'm in

[Pre-Chorus: Damian Marley]
In this world of calamity
Dirty looks and grudges and jealousy
And police weh abuse dem authority
Media clowns we nuh know bout variety, boom

[Verse 3: Damian ""Jr. Gong"" Marley]
Di youngest veteran a come murder dem slow
Ragamuffin sent to God before di bush bungalow
Mi nuh watch it mek I carry out my voice now figarow
Emerge from the darkness with mi big blunt a glow
Di hammer dem a slam and spend day a dead now
Some bwoy could a big like Bam Bam Bigelow
Buss off trigger finger, trigger hand and trigger toe
A two gun mi have mi buss dem inna stereo, 'cause

[Chorus: Damian Marley]
I got to keep on walkin', on the road to Zion, man
Hey, we got to keep it burnin', on the road to Zion, man

[Bridge: Damian Marley]
Clean and pure meditation without a doubt
Don't mek dem tek yuh like who dem took out
Jah will be waitin there we a shout
Jah will be waitin there!
Clean and pure meditation without a doubt
Don't mek dem tek yuh like food dem to goat
Jah will be waitin there we a shout
Jah will be waitin there!

[Pre-Chorus: Damian Marley]
In this world of calamity
Dirty looks and grudges and jealousy
And police weh abuse dem authority

Where the wind blows tall
Because Tony Franciosa
Used to date my ma
They got some money out there
They're giving it away
I'm gonna do what I want
And I'm gonna get paid
Do what I want
And I'm gonna get paid

Little brown sausages
Lying in the sand
I ain't no extra baby
I'm a leading man
Well, my parole officer
Will be proud of me
With my Olds 88
And the devil on a leash

I know karate, Voodoo too
I'm gonna make myself available to you
I don't need no make up
I got real scars
I got hair on my chest
I look good without a shirt

Well I don't lose my composure
In a high speed chase
Well my friends think I'm ugly
I got a masculine face
I got some dragstrip courage
I can really drive a bed
I'm gonna change my name to Hannibal
Or maybe just Rex
Change my name to Hannibal
Maybe just Rex

I know karate, Voodoo too
I'm gonna make myself available to you
I don't need no make up
I got real scars
I got hair on my chest
I look good without a shirt

I'm gonna drive all night
Take some speed
I'm gonna wait for the sun
To shine down on me
I cut a hole in my roof
The shape of a heart
And I'm goin' out west
Where they'll appreciate me
Going out west
Going out west"

You have forsaken all the love you’ve taken
Sleeping on a razor, there’s nowhere left to fall
Your body’s aching, every bone is breaking
Nothing seems to shake it, it just keeps holding on
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Verse 2]
Your soul is able, death is all you cradle
Sleeping on the nails, there’s nowhere left to fall
You have admired, every man desires
Everyone is king when there’s no one left to pawn
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
There is no peace here, war is never cheap, dear
Love will never meet it, it just gets sold for parts
You cannot fight it, all the world denies it
Open up your eyelids and let your demons run
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Interlude]

[Outro]
I thread the needle through, you beat the devil’s tattoo
I thread the needle through, you beat the devil’s tattoo
I thread the needle through, you beat the devil’s tattoo
I thread the needle through, you beat the devil’s tattoo
I thread the needle through, you beat the devil’s tattoo
I thread the needle through, you beat the devil’s tattoo
I thread the needle through, you beat the devil’s tattoo
I thread the needle through, you beat the devil’s tattoo"

Pull up with a stick, I pull up with a stick (Mike WiLL Made-It)
I'll pull up with a pink toe, I'm whippin', she suckin' this dick (Ear Drummers)
I put some diamonds on her toes, let that ho know that I'm rich
We was used to pullin' kick doors (That money go for Myles)

[Chorus: Gunna]
I've been gettin' it since a toddler, I keep dollars on my head
Bein' a real one is my motto, handle my problems, I ain't scared
I put Prada on my collar 'cause she proud of what I said
I'm a leader, I got 'em followin' my footsteps like the feds
I shoot like I'm Montana, chopper bullets make 'em shed, uh
Black on black new Phantom, in the backseat sippin' red, uh
Bitch, I'm from Atlanta where these hoes ride the dick like peg, yeah
Condo like the pharmacy, I got codeine in my fridge, pour up

[Verse 1: Gunna]
My bro on a steamin' stove, cookin' crack like grits
Got this vibe on her tippy toes, strokin' her in a pent'
LA live, I'm stayin' at the Loews with this Hollywood bitch
Got a nine and a snubnose (Let's go), can't wait to let it hit (Hit)
Pull up with a stick, I'll pull up with a stick
I'll pull up with a pink toe, I'm whippin', she suckin' this dick
I'll put some diamonds on her toes, let that ho know that I'm rich (Let that ho know that I'm rich)
We was used to pullin' kick doors, you could still call it a lick (Lick)
You broke and can't be fixed (Nah), went to Neimans and spent a nick (Hah)
How you poor? That don't make sense (Ah), I made a whole mile off an inch (An inch)
I had ninety-nine problems, I just scratched your ho off the list (Scratched your ho off the list)
Got some millions and went and solved 'em, now my neck cost a quarter brick (Brick)

I've been gettin' it since a toddler, I keep dollars on my head
Bein' a real one is my motto, handle my problems, I ain't scared

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Bestie, bestie, I just hit my friend
Told her ""Catch me"" (Woah), ""Catch me"" (Woah), I'ma lick her skin
She so precious, precious, might not fuck again
She too messy, messy, but hittin', no flexin' (No flexin')
Rose gold ornaments (Rose)
Dropped the two tint, car came with no tint (Damn)
You don't gotta use the door, you can hop in front of tip
Bond 9 in the vent, think 'bout dyin' and get spent
I got two B's on my boxers and a thottie in the bed (Yeah)
I know niggas ran up a milli', still didn't tell 12 shit (12, 12, 12, shh)
I got skeletons in my closets (Woah), and they scared of me and shit (Closets and they scared)
Maison Margielas under the bed screamin', ""Rock me, kid"" (Woah)
I put water on my head, then she got seasick (I put water on my head)
Couple opps played dead (What?), and they still got hit
I done bent lil' mama's spine but that still ain't my kid (Still ain't my kid)
Only reason I answer my line (Why?), is 'cause she drink my spit (No cap)
