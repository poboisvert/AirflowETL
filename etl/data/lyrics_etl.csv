Well, my goodness gracious, let me tell you the news
My head's been wet with the midnight dew
I've been down on bended knee, talkin' to the man from Galilee
He spoke to me in the voice so sweet
I thought I heard the shuffle of angel's feet
He called my name and my heart stood still
When he said, ""John, go do My will!""

Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back-biter
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down

Workin' in the dark against your fellow man
But as sure as God made black and white
What's done in the dark will be brought to the light

5 black maybach when we in (nigga I need)
Everybody real when we in (nigga I need)
The real doc story to begin when we in

Verse 1
160 seconds later New York to Decatur
I squeeze through the crater bringing ignorant flavor
Grabbing on my nuts middle fingers to the haters
Both palms put together getting strength from my savior

No love for a thug wanna be be your self
And if you really live that life don’t put the burner on the shelf
Keep it closer than an enemy tryna get into your business
Remember when you spray don’t never leave out a witness

Witness greatness on track double back and look again
I ain’t perfect but I know to make the best out all my sins
Use it to my advantage and manage to breathe fire again
So when the homies at your door it’s best you let them niggas in

Verse 2
N I g g a z
Me and mine c r a z
The type to catch you flossing the gold and the ap
Leave you butt naked scrambling wondering how could it be

Watch your six don’t depend on a soul to love your soul
I don’t trust a single soul its like my heart is made of cole
Emotions up and down like a stripper working the pole
Be acting solid really a hoe under pressure you gone fold

Better know the vibes or these streets will eat you a live
Move correct for no surprise its simple to coincide
Strap in for the ride to get some white only pie
Keep determination strong and deception stuck in yah eye

When we in

Up out of there
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Eh, light that up, Snoop! Why you actin' like that?
Ahh shit, you done fucked up now
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
You done put two of America's most wanted
In the same motherfuckin' place at the same motherfuckin' time?
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
Ha, ha, ha, ha, y'all niggas about to feel this
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
Break out the champagne glasses and the motherfuckin' condoms
Have one on us, a'ight?
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
A toast to the gangsters

Verse 1: 2Pac
Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Bombin' hoochies with precision, my intention's to get richer
With the S-N double-O-P, Dogg, my fuckin' homie
You's a cold-ass nigga on them hogs

Verse 2: Snoop Doggy Dogg
Sho 'nuff, I keep my hand on my gun
'Cause they got me on the run
Now I'm back in the courtroom, waitin' on the outcome
""Free 2Pac"" is all that's on a nigga's mind
But at the same time, it seems they tryin' to take mine
So I'ma get smart and get defensive and shit
And put together a Million March for some gangsta shit

Verse 3: 2Pac
So now they got us laced
Two multi-millionaire motherfuckers catchin' cases
Bitches, get ready for the throw down, the shit's about to go down
Me and Snoop about to clown
I'm losin' my religion, I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin'
Niggas be actin' like they savage, they out to get the cabbage
I've got nothin' but love for my niggas livin' lavish

Verse 4: Snoop Doggy Dogg
I've got a pit named Petey, she Nigerino
I've got a house out in the hills, right next to Chino
And I think I've got a black Bimmer
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Siegel, and do it all legal
And get scooped up by the little homie in the Regal
It feels good to you, baby-bubba
You see, this is for the G's and the keys, motherfucker

Verse 5: 2Pac
Now, follow as we ride!
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the Westside!
And I can make you famous
Niggas been dyin' for years, so how can they blame us?
I live in fear of a felony
I never stop bailin' these motherfuckin' G's
If you got it, better flaunt it

Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party

Verse 6: 2Pac
Now give me fifty feet, defeat is not my destiny
Release me to the streets, and keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is misery, suffery is greed
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me
I bust and flee
These niggas must be crazy, what?!
There ain't no mercy, motherfuckers, who can fade the thug?
You thought it was, but it wasn't, now disappear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player

Verse 7: Snoop Doggy Dogg
It's like, Cuh, Blood, gang-bangin'
Everybody in the party doin' dope-slangin'
You gotta have paper in this world
You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
You doin' your job every day
And then you work so hard 'til your hair turn gray
Let me tell you 'bout life and 'bout the way it is
You see, we live by the gun, so we die by the guns, kid

Verse 8: 2Pac
They tell me not to roll with my Glock
So now I got a throw-away
Floatin' in the black Benz (Bitch), tryin' to do a show a day
They wonder how I live with five shots
Niggas is hard to kill on my block
Schemes for currency and dough-related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm tryin' to get up on it
My nigga, Dogg, and me, eternally the most wanted
