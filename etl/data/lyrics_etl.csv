You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down

Chorus 2
Go tell that long-tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back-biter
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down

Verse 1
Well, my goodness gracious, let me tell you the news
My head's been wet with the midnight dew
I've been down on bended knee, talkin' to the man from Galilee
He spoke to me in the voice so sweet
I thought I heard the shuffle of angel's feet
He called my name and my heart stood still
When he said, ""John, go do My will!""

Chorus 2
Go tell that long-tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back-biter
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down

Chorus 1
You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down

Verse 2
Well, you may throw your rock, and hide your hand
Workin' in the dark against your fellow man
But as sure as God made black and white
What's done in the dark will be brought to the light

Chorus 1
You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down

Chorus 2
Go tell that long-tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back-biter
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut you down
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut you down
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut you dow"

Another mad man done struck again
Rain and fire crossed that ocean
Another mad man done struck again

Sitting down here fallout shelter
Paint my walls, twice a week
Sitting down here fallout shelter
Think about the slaves, long time ago

Ten million slaves crossed that Ocean
They had shackles on their Legs
Ten million slaves crossed that Ocean
They had shackles on their Legs

Don't know where, where they're going
Don't know where, where they've been
Don't know where, where they're going
Don't know where, where they've been

Sun goes out, you'll be standing
You'll be standing by yourself
Sun goes out, you'll be standing
You'll be standing by yourself

Ten million slaves crossed that Ocean
They had shackles on their legs
Ten million slaves crossed that Ocean
They had shackles on their legs

Don't know where, where they're going
Don't know where, where they've been
Don't know where, where they're going
Don't know where, where they've been

Ten million slaves crossed that ocean
They had shackles on their legs
Food goes bad, food looks Rancid
But they ate it anyway

Don't know where, where they're going
Don't know where, where they've been
Don't know where, where they're going
Don't know where, where they've been

Sun goes out, you'll be standing
You'll be standing all alone
Sun goes out, you'll be standing
You'll be standing all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone, all alon"

You have forsaken all the love you’ve taken
Sleeping on a razor, there’s nowhere left to fall
Your body’s aching, every bone is breaking
Nothing seems to shake it, it just keeps holding on
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Verse 2
Your soul is able, death is all you cradle
Sleeping on the nails, there’s nowhere left to fall
You have admired, every man desires
Everyone is king when there’s no one left to pawn
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Interlude

Verse 3
There is no peace here, war is never cheap, dear
Love will never meet it, it just gets sold for parts
You cannot fight it, all the world denies it
Open up your eyelids and let your demons run
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Interlude

I thread the needle through, you beat the devil’s tattoo

I thread the needle through, you beat the devil’s tattoo

Operator, please put me back on the line
Told my girl I'd be back
Operator, please
This is wreckin' my mind

Chorus
Oh, can it be?
The voices calling me
They get lost and out of time
I should've seen it glow
But everybody knows that a broken heart is blind

Verse 2
Pick you up, let you down
When I wanna go to a place I can hide
You know me, I had plans
But they just disappeared to the back of my mind

They get lost and out of time
I should've seen it glow

Treasure maps, fallen trees
Operator, please call me back when it's time
Stolen friends and disease
Operator, please patch me back to my mind

Sunshine beating on the good times
Moonlight raising from the grave
String band playing worn out honkey-tonks

Coyote chewing on a cigarette
Pack o' young boys going howlin' at the moon

Two witnesses below and up high

You can call me a sinner for wondering why

Just as familiar as a bottle and a glass

Intro: Drake
Astro, yeah

Verse 1: Travis Scott &amp; The Notorious B.I.G.
(Woo) Made this here with all the ice on in the booth
At the gate outside, when they pull up, they get me loose
Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hoppin' out coupes
This shit way too big, when we pull up, give me the loot (Gimme the loot!)
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two-four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 AM and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mixes pop like Jamba Juice
Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose

Bridge: Big Hawk &amp; Swae Lee

Verse 2: Travis Scott &amp; Uncle Luke
Yeah, this shit way too formal, y'all know I don't follow suit
Stacey Dash, most of these girls ain't got a clue
All of these hoes I made off records I produced
I might take all my exes and put 'em all in a group
Hit my eses, I need the bootch
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her, ""Hop in, you comin' too""
In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke
(Don't stop, pop that pussy!)
Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said, ""Where we goin'?"" I said, ""The moon""
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool
Now I got her open, it's just the Goose
Who put this shit together? I'm the glue

Shorty FaceTimed me out the blue
