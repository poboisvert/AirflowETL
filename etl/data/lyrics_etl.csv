1,0VW1dAC98JfVPLGd7oj2lM,Ten Million Slaves,2022-02-22T23:48:50.785Z,"Rain and fire crossed that ocean
Another mad man done struck again
Rain and fire crossed that ocean
Another mad man done struck again

Sitting down here fallout shelter
Paint my walls, twice a week
Sitting down here fallout shelter
Think about the slaves, long time ago

Ten million slaves crossed that Ocean
They had shackles on their Legs
Ten million slaves crossed that Ocean
They had shackles on their Legs

Don't know where, where they're going
Don't know where, where they've been
Don't know where, where they're going
Don't know where, where they've been

Sun goes out, you'll be standing
You'll be standing by yourself
Sun goes out, you'll be standing
You'll be standing by yourself

Ten million slaves crossed that Ocean
They had shackles on their legs
Ten million slaves crossed that Ocean
They had shackles on their legs

Don't know where, where they're going
Don't know where, where they've been
Don't know where, where they're going
Don't know where, where they've been

Ten million slaves crossed that ocean
They had shackles on their legs
Food goes bad, food looks Rancid
But they ate it anyway

Don't know where, where they're going
Don't know where, where they've been
Don't know where, where they're going
Don't know where, where they've been

Sun goes out, you'll be standing
You'll be standing all alone
Sun goes out, you'll be standing
You'll be standing all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone, all alon"

You have forsaken all the love you’ve taken
Sleeping on a razor, there’s nowhere left to fall
Your body’s aching, every bone is breaking
Nothing seems to shake it, it just keeps holding on
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Verse 2
Your soul is able, death is all you cradle
Sleeping on the nails, there’s nowhere left to fall
You have admired, every man desires
Everyone is king when there’s no one left to pawn
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Interlude

Verse 3
There is no peace here, war is never cheap, dear
Love will never meet it, it just gets sold for parts
You cannot fight it, all the world denies it
Open up your eyelids and let your demons run
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Interlude

Outro
I thread the needle through, you beat the devil’s tattoo
I thread the needle through, you beat the devil’s tattoo
I thread the needle through, you beat the devil’s tattoo
I thread the needle through, you beat the devil’s tattoo
I thread the needle through, you beat the devil’s tattoo
I thread the needle through, you beat the devil’s tattoo
I thread the needle through, you beat the devil’s tattoo
I thread the needle through, you beat the devil’s tatto"

Little black submarines
Operator, please put me back on the line
Told my girl I'd be back
Operator, please
This is wreckin' my mind

Chorus
Oh, can it be?
The voices calling me
They get lost and out of time
I should've seen it glow
But everybody knows that a broken heart is blind
That a broken heart is blind

Verse 2
Pick you up, let you down
When I wanna go to a place I can hide
You know me, I had plans
But they just disappeared to the back of my mind

Chorus
Oh, can it be?
The voices calling me
They get lost and out of time
I should've seen it glow
But everybody knows that a broken heart is blind
That a broken heart is blind

Treasure maps, fallen trees
Operator, please call me back when it's time
Stolen friends and disease
Operator, please patch me back to my mind

Sunshine beating on the good times
Moonlight raising from the grave
String band playing worn out honkey-tonks
Pretty young thing going dancing in the rain

Coyote chewing on a cigarette
Pack o' young boys going howlin' at the moon

Three dead in a crash on the number 4
Two witnesses below and up high
Not sure whose will be done
You can call me a sinner for wondering why

Running through the trees honey
Hey darlin'!
Leaving for the next town

I swear I've seen ya face elsewhere before
Just as familiar as a bottle and a glass

Intro: Drake
Astro, yeah
Sun is down, freezin' cold
That's how we already know, winter's here

Part II

Verse 1: Travis Scott &amp; The Notorious B.I.G.
(Woo) Made this here with all the ice on in the booth
At the gate outside, when they pull up, they get me loose
Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hoppin' out coupes
This shit way too big, when we pull up, give me the loot (Gimme the loot!)
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two-four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 AM and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mixes pop like Jamba Juice
Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose

Bridge: Big Hawk &amp; Swae Lee
Some-Some-Some-Someone said
To win the retreat, we all in too deep
Play-Play-Playin' for keeps, don't play us for weak (Someone said)
To win the retreat, we all in too deep
Play-Play-Playin' for keeps, don't play us for weak

Verse 2: Travis Scott &amp; Uncle Luke
Yeah, this shit way too formal, y'all know I don't follow suit
Stacey Dash, most of these girls ain't got a clue
All of these hoes I made off records I produced
I might take all my exes and put 'em all in a group
Hit my eses, I need the bootch
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her, ""Hop in, you comin' too""
In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke
(Don't stop, pop that pussy!)
Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said, ""Where we goin'?"" I said, ""The moon""
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool
Now I got her open, it's just the Goose
Who put this shit together? I'm the glue

Bridge: Travis Scott, Swae Lee &amp; Big Hawk
Someone said
Shorty FaceTimed me out the blue
Someone said
Play-Playin' for keeps

That coca

Chorus: NAV
I just poured an eight in a liter
Throw some Jolly Rancher in, make it sweeter
Versace my clothes, I'm with a white ho
And she snortin' three lines like Adidas
Got a black girl rollin' off molly
Got a white bitch snortin' up snow
Say she want real niggas in the party
Parents gon' leave the keys to the condo

Post-Chorus: NAV
Bitch, close the door, there's shit on your nose (That coca)
She said she want more, she said she want more
So I'ma get more, yeah, I'ma get more

She said she want more, she said she want more
So I'ma get more, yeah, I'ma get more

Verse 1: NAV
I just poured an eight in a liter
With a white bitch sniffin' on Bieber
Are you sure you want to party with the demons?
Bitch lookin' for a phone, I ain't seen it
Told Frost bring the water, no Fiji
Free Stix, I'm poured up and I'm leanin'
I got a couple pussy niggas in their feelings
'Cause the main bitch wanna come see me
She said she want more, your girl is a ho
You need to let go, she fucked all my bros
She snortin' the snow (That coca), now she's touchin' her toes
She got Anna Nicole all in her nose
If they kick down the door, we gon' get locked for sure
She said she want more, fuck it, I'ma get more (I'ma get more)
